# ObjectLocalizationUsingTensorflow
In this project, we use images of emojis designed by [openmoji](https://openmoji.org/) â€“ the open-source emoji and icon project. License: CC BY-SA 4.0 and generate a bigger size image with 10 of such emojis embedded
using a datagenerator() and train our model using them to localize emoji in the image using bounding box.
